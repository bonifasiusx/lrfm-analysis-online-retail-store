# Customer Segmentation with LRFM Analysis

This project performs customer segmentation using the LRFM (Length, Recency, Frequency, Monetary) with simple KMeans clustering on UK online retail dataset from 2009-2011. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior and value to support marketing and retention strategies.

## Purpose

This project was built as part of the Portfolio Build assignment in the Data Science Bootcamp at **Purwadhika Digital Technology School** (Module 2 - Data Analysis). It aims to apply classic marketing analytics techniques to real transactional data and develop skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and clustering.
